I am a software engineer from Vienna, Austria with a university degree in Molecular Biology/Bioinformatics. I am currently a Software Engineering Intern at Facebook in London. 

I have recently made the switch from biology to computer science. Since then I have been visiting the [Computational Genomics Lab](https://cgl.genomics.ucsc.edu/) at the University of California Santa Cruz, where I was working on the [visualization of graph genomes](https://github.com/wolfib/sequenceTubeMap). After returning home to Vienna I joined [Catalysts](https://www.catalysts.cc), an Austrian software development company, only to leave again for London and my current gig.

In my previous work life as a biologist I've been a Product Manager for [Roche Diagnostics](http://www.roche.com/about/business/diagnostics.htm). 

When I'm not working I enjoy being outdoors and dabble in various kinds of water and mountain sports.
