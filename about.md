I am a software engineer from Vienna, Austria with a university degree in Molecular Biology/Bioinformatics.

After working as a Software Engineering Intern at Facebook in London at the beginning of 2018, I am now back in Vienna doing freelancing work. I have been visiting the [Computational Genomics Lab](https://cgl.genomics.ucsc.edu/) at the University of California Santa Cruz before, and since then I have been working with them on the [visualization of graph genomes](https://github.com/vgteam/sequenceTubeMap) time and again.

In my previous work life as a biologist I've been a Product Manager for [Roche Diagnostics](http://www.roche.com/about/business/diagnostics.htm).

When I'm not working I enjoy being outdoors and dabble in various kinds of water and mountain sports.
